## What is this repoooo? 

- This repo is me writing my notes from reading this book by [Micheal Stack](https://www.amazon.com/Event-Driven-Architecture-Golang-asynchronicity-consistency/dp/1803238011)
- This repo will also contains the code from my reading and learnings.

## Learnings so far
- Hexagonal pattern
- An overview of DDD again
- Eventstorming for requirement gathering (pretty hard, need another read)
- Scaffolding a modular monolith with gRPC, openapiv2 and grpc-gateway
- Setting up migrations script for database in docker for local environment (Might move away to something better, currently it's just bash script executing sql script in PG)
- Bulding a modular monolith and starting with the store service
